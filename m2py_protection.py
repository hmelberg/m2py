"""Protection policy + the pandas ProtectionAdapter for SafeStat remote compute.

resolve_policy turns one-or-more source protection levels into a single policy
(most-restrictive-source-wins). The suppression numbers come from safepy's
tier presets when the vendored safepy package is importable (the server), so
both engines read ONE shared config; the fallback table below mirrors those
presets for non-server contexts (Pyodide, bare test runs).

PandasProtect wraps the `protect` package for result-side disclosure control:
count-bearing result tables (tabulate's "n", summarize's "count") go through
the full protect.suppress with counts pairing + rounding. Aggregate tables
without a count column and model objects pass through for now — they are the
next slice (the DSL ops must emit contribution counts first).
